**Zen Command Palette** is a powerful, extensible command interface for Zen Browser, seamlessly integrated directly into the URL bar. Inspired by the command palettes in modern productivity tools like **Arc Browser**, **Raycast**, and **Vivaldi**, it provides a fast and efficient way to control your browser with just a few keystrokes.

## 🌟 Features

- ⚡ **Feels Native**: Utilizes the browser's URL bar for a seamless experience.
- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search & Smart Sorting**: Effortlessly locate what you need with a robust fuzzy search feature.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Commands**: Automatically generates commands for your installed search engines, extensions, workspaces, folders, and internal `about:` pages.
- 🛠️ **Extensible API**: User scripts and browser modifications can easily add their own commands, making the palette a central hub for all your custom actions.
- 🎨 **Highly Customizable**: Offers customizable keyboard shortcuts, widgets, icons, dynamic commands, and more.
- ⌨️ **Custom Commands**: Make your own commands with custom JS or chaining other commands.

## 🔧 Extensibility

Adding your own commands from other scripts is straightforward. The `ZenCommandPalette` object is exposed on the `window`, allowing you to use its API to add both static and dynamic commands. I encourage all mod creators to incorporate this into their own mods (especially ones with JS).

### Other Mods Which Support Command Palette

- [Advanced Tab Groups](https://github.com/12th-devs/Advanced-Tab-Groups)
- [AI Tab Groups](https://github.com/Darsh-A/Ai-TabGroups-ZenBrowser/)
- [Quick Tabs](https://github.com/Darsh-A/Quick-Tabs/)
- [Reopen Closed Tabs Menu](https://github.com/Vertex-Mods/Reopen-Closed-Tabs-Menu)
- [Browse Bot](https://github.com/Vertex-Mods/Browse-Bot)
- [Zen Library](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Zen-Library)

### Adding a Static Command

Static commands are added once and are always available, unless their `condition` evaluates to false.

```javascript
// Example from another .uc.js file
if (window.ZenCommandPalette) {
  window.ZenCommandPalette.addCommand({
    key: "open-reddit",
    label: "Open Reddit",
    command: () => {
      // Your mod's reload logic here. This function is executed when the command is selected.
      // It can be synchronous or asynchronous
      openTrustedLinkIn("https://reddit.com", "tab");
    },
    icon: "https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png", // Optional: URL to an icon.
    tags: ["reddit", "memes", "social"], // Optional: Extra keywords for fuzzy search.
    condition: () => true, // Optional: A function that returns a boolean. The command only appears if it returns true.
  });
}
```

If you omit the `command` function, the palette will attempt to execute a built-in `<command>` element on the main browser window with an `id` that matches the `key`.

### Adding a Dynamic Command Provider

For commands that change based on application state (e.g., a list of open tabs), you can add a dynamic provider. This is a function that gets called when the palette is opened for the first time. The results are cached for performance and the cache is cleared when the URL bar is closed.

```javascript
// Example from another .uc.js file
if (window.ZenCommandPalette) {
  const generateMyDynamicCommands = async () => {
    // This function should return a Promise that resolves to an array of command objects.
    const items = getMyModItems(); // Get the current state
    return items.map((item) => ({
      key: `my-mod:do-thing:${item.id}`,
      label: `Do Thing with ${item.name}`,
      command: () => doThingWith(item.id),
      tags: [item.name],
    }));
  };

  // The second argument is a preference key. If provided, the provider will only run
  // if that preference is set to true. If omitted, it will always run.
  window.ZenCommandPalette.addDynamicCommandsProvider(
    generateMyDynamicCommands,
    "my-mod.commands.enabled" // Example preference key
  );
}
```

## ❓ FAQ

I am not making up the questions. I have been asked these questions in Reddit and discord multiple times.

<details>
<summary><h3>What is difference between this and native zen command bar (released recently)</h3></summary>
Zen command bar don't contain too much commands to optimize for performance, this mod contain 100+ static commands. And on top of it, this provides API making easy for user to add more commands. Already 4 other mods support the command palette.

Another Benefit of this mod, is that this allows setting custom keymaps to commands, and allow adding them as toolbar icons.
